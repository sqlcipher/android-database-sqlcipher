*** Update May 2011:

After some major breakthroughs during last week’s development sprint, we’re extremely excited to announce SQLCipher for Android, Developer Preview r1. SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. To date, it has been open-sourced, sponsored and maintained by Zetetic LLC, and we are glad to be able to extend their efforts to a new mobile platform. In the mobile space, SQLCipher has enjoyed widespread use in Apple’s iOS, as well as Nokia / QT for quite some time. Given that Android by default provides integrated support for SQLite databases, our goal was to create an almost identical API for SQLCipher, so that developers of all skill level could use it, without a steep learning curve.

In an environment where mobile data privacy is increasingly in the headlines, this project will make it easier than ever for mobile developers to properly secure their local application data, and in turn better protect the privacy of their users. The data stored by Android apps protected by this type of encryption will be less vulnerable to access by malicious apps, protected in case of device loss or theft, and highly resistant to mobile data forensics tools that are increasingly used to mass copy a mobile device during routine traffic stops.

However, while the core SQLCipher database is vetted and market-ready, the Android support libraries in this release are still very much alpha quality, hence the Developer Preview label. This R1 release should not be integrated into critical or production software. Our goal is to give Android developers early access to the technology, so they can provide feedback on our approach, and help us deliver the right offering for securing mobile data. We expect to release a market-ready version this summer, and will be publicly iterating through the codebase until then.

*** An Illustrative Terminal Listing

A typical SQLite database in unencrypted, and visually parseable even as encoded text. The following example shows the difference between hexdumps of a standard SQLite db and one implementing SQLCipher.

:  ~ sjlombardo$ hexdump -C sqlite.db

*** Details for Developers

We’ve packaged up a very simple SDK for any Android developer to add SQLCipher into their app with the following three steps:

Add a single sqlcipher.jar and a few .so’s to the application libs directory
Update the import path from android.database.sqlite.* to info.guardianproject.database.sqlite.* in any source files that reference it. The original android.database.Cursor can still be used unchanged.
Init the database in onCreate() and pass a variable argument to the open database method with a password*:
SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context
SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase(“thisismysecret”):
*Note: we are working on some dialog builder helper methods for password and PIN input, password caching, and other features that we would like to standardize across all applications that use SQLCipher.

*** Compatibility

The Developer Preview implements SQLCipher v1, is compatible with Android 2.2 & 2.3, and works only within one process (you can’t pass a Cursor from a remote Service to an Activity).

Notepad + SQLCipher = Notepadbot

Notepadbot is a sample application pulled from the standard Android samples code and updated to use SQLCipher. You can browse the source here and download the apk here.

*** Building

In order to build android-database-sqlcipher from source you will need both the Android SDK as well as Android NDK.  Once you have cloned the repo, change directory into the root of the repository and run the following commands:

:  # this only needs to be done once
:  make init

:  # to build the source
:  make

Copy =libsqlcipher_android.so= in =external/libs/armeabi= and  =libdatabase_sqlcipher.so= in =jni/libs/armeabi= to your application =libs/armeabi= folder.  Copy the =sqlcipher.jar= file in =bin/classes= to your =libs= directory.  Copy the =icudt44l.zip= file in the =assets= directory to your =assets= directory.  Finally, you will need to copy =commons-codec.jar= and =guava-r09.jar= located in the =libs= directory into your application =libs= directory.

*** Final Notes

It’s important to note that this project is not intended to be a distinct, long-term fork of SQLCipher. We’ve been working closely with the SQLCipher team at Zetetic and fully intent to closely maintain the project as SQLCipher evolves, re-integrating changes in upcoming releases such as SQLCipher v2.

The Android support libraries are licensed under Apache 2.0, in line with the Android OS code on which they are based. The SQLCipher code itself is licensed under a BSD-style license from Zetetic LLC. Finally, the original SQLite code itself is in the public domain.
