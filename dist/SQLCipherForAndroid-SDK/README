2011/11/29

CHANGELOG
- includes icu44 data file for devices without it built-in ( < 2.2)
- complete support for original Android SQLite/database package APIs
- improved platform support through unified library (less lib .so files)
- added support for CrossProcess Cursors
- now support Observers/callbacks

CURRENT TESTED PLATFORM SUPPORT

Android 2.1 (SDK Level 7)
Android 2.2 (SDK Level 8)
Android 2.3 (SDK Level 9)
Android 2.3.3 (SDK Level 10)
Android 3.0 (SDK Level 11)
Android 3.1 (SDK Level 12)
Android 3.2 (SDK Level 13)
Android 4.0 (Not Tested)

HOW TO

1) copy the libs folder into your project. If you are targeting 2.2 and below, include the 'icudt44l.zip' in the assets folder as well.

2) Update your import path from android.database to info.guardianproject.database and you are almost there!

3) then when you open your database, just pass a variable argument to the open database method with your password:
	
	SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context
	SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase("thisismysecret"):

4) run your app to ensure all the libraries are being loaded correctly, and that your app runs.

5) You will need to implement a passcode entry user interface to your application, as well. 
The longer the passcode, the better.
